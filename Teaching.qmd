My primary area of study is in international relations and comparative politics, and teaching courses in these subfields involve understanding and analyzing global problems often beyond our immediate contexts. I believe that the first step in understanding such complex situations is to develop an empathic concern by visualizing problems through the eyes of main actors on the ground and their interests and preferences. The next step is analyzing "why" behind the events as these interests and preferences interact.
